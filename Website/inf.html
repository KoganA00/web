			<p>New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.</p>
			<p>It contains two main islands (North and South) and numerous smaller islands. </p>
			<p> Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="climate">
			<p>New Zealand has a mild climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 16 °C.</p> 
			<p>Christchurch is the driest city, receiving only 640 mm of rain per year and Wellington is the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount.</p>
			<p>Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine.</p>  
			<p>The general snow season is about early June until early October in the South Island. </p>
			<p>Snowfall is less common on the North Island, although it does occur. </p>
		</div>
		 
		<div id="animals">
			<p>The animals of New Zealand have an unusual history. 
			<p>The islands were part of Gondwana, from which they separated 84 million years ago. </p>
			<p>New Zealand has some animals, birds and plants which survive from that time.</p>
			<p>The islands are well known for moas birds.</p>
			<p>For millions of years only predators were birds, such as the giant Haast's eagle.</p>
			<p>At that time the country's only mammals were bats and seals and sea lions.</p>
			<p>Because of this, the country has an unusually large number of flightless birds, of which only the kiwi, and the kakapo survive.</p>
			<p>There are also about 60 species of lizard, 4 species of frog and 2 species of tuatara. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="politics">
			<p>The politics of New Zealand function within a framework of a unitary parliamentary representative democracy.</p>
			<p>New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy in which a hereditary monarch, Queen Elizabeth II - is the sovereign and head of state.</p>
			<p>Executive power in New Zealand is based on the principle that "The Queen reigns, but the government rules".</p>
			<p>The office of prime minister is, in practice, the most powerful political office in New Zealand. </p>
			<p>Government ministers are selected from the elected members of the New Zealand Parliament.</p>
