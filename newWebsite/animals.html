<p>The animals of New Zealand have an unusual history. 
			<p>The islands were part of Gondwana, from which they separated 84 million years ago. </p>
			<p>New Zealand has some animals, birds and plants which survive from that time.</p>
			<p>At that time the country's only mammals were bats and seals and sea lions.</p>
			<p>Because of this, the country has an unusually large number of flightless birds.</p>
			<p>There are also about 60 species of lizard, 4 species of frog and 2 species of tuatara. </p></td>
