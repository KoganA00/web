The animals of New Zealand have an unusual history. <br>
			The islands were part of Gondwana, from which they separated 84 million years ago. <br>
			New Zealand has some animals, birds and plants which survive from that time.<br>
			At that time the country's only mammals were bats and seals and sea lions.<br>
			Because of this, the country has an unusually large number of flightless birds.<br>
			There are also about 60 species of lizard, 4 species of frog and 2 species of tuatara. </td>
