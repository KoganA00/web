	The politics of New Zealand function within a framework of a unitary parliamentary representative democracy.<br>
			New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy in which a hereditary monarch, Queen Elizabeth II - is the sovereign and head of state.<br>
			Executive power in New Zealand is based on the principle that "The Queen reigns, but the government rules".<br>
			The office of prime minister is, in practice, the most powerful political office in New Zealand. <br>
			Government ministers are selected from the elected members of the New Zealand Parliament.</td><td>
